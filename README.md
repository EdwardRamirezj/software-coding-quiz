# Coding Quiz

## User Story
This week, our skills were put to test in creating a coding quiz using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Below is are the minimun requirements:

* WHEN I click the start button, a timer starts and I am presented with a question.
* WHEN I answer a question, I am presented with another question.
* WHEN I answer a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock.
* WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over.
* WHEN the game is over, I can save my initials and my score.

## Accepted Criteria
It's been a challenging week. The best approach for this weeks project was to break down the requirements into small components (aka Pseudo coding). Creating a systematic HTML sheet with attributes that I used to display/hide certain containers during the course of the game. The css was used to position the buttons, timer, and content in the center of the screen. Things did get complicated when I began adding fuctions to the js script. One of the takeaways was that I needed to follow a systematic flow to ensure that the code would run properly and not have any buggin issues. The challenging part of this was getting the questions to display with button attributes when they got displayed on the screen. In the time given I ensured that the project met most of the requirements. The only 2 objects missing are the initial input and time reducer when the user clicks the wrong answer. The updated file should be uploaded within a couple of days.
